The Fast Flow process can be validated by utilizing the \ntools on the following pages. Once the process can be validated to completion, it \nshould be routinely validated, to ensure everything stays on track and efficiency is \nmaximized. \nHow will you make sure the program sticks? \n\u2022\nTrain all Associates utilizing best practices\n\u2022\nObserve and coach in the moment, to guide and recognize Associate performance\n\u2022\nUse the tracking tools to monitor processing and flowing of goods, as needed\n\u2022\nCelebrate improvements and recognize Associates with S.O.A.R cards\n\u2022\nMake it fun! Create contests for the best CPH, flowing goods to the floor, or the best\nfeature. Having fun and keeping your Associates engaged will drive great results\nValidation Instructions: \nTo ensure store teams are set for success in the backroom, it is necessary to validate \nthe Fast Flow process from start to finish. It is important that each area is assessed and \nonly validated to completion. If an area cannot yet be validated, it should be addressed \nand fixed immediately. \nFast Flow Validation should be conducted first as a store self-assessment, with the \nOperations ASM and Store Manager, and after successful self-validation, the Store \nManager must validate the process in partnership with their District Manager. The Fast \nFlow SOP should be used to aid the validation process to ensure setup and flow are set \nto standard / reset as needed. \nPrint the following validation pages and utilize the space between each validation point \nto make note of areas to recognize or improve. Do not check off a validation point until \nit is to standard.  Completed validation pages should be retained for 6 months in the \nfiling cabinet by the backroom computer. \nAreas to validate: \n\u2022\nBackroom Layout and Equipment\n\u2022\nTruck Team \u2013 roles and responsibilities\n\u2022\nLeadership Team \u2013 roles and responsibilities\n\u2022\nReceiving and Productivity Tracking\n\u2022\nFlowing Merchandise\n",

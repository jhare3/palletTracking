      "text": "2 \n \n  \nIntroduction \nFast Flow is the Sierra term for processing and flowing merchandise from start to finish. \nThe process is broken down into two main parts: processing merchandise in the \nbackroom and flowing merchandise to the sales floor. The following document \ndescribes both parts in detail. All stores are expected to process trucks and flow \nmerchandise to this standard. \n \nProcessing and flowing merchandise must be accompanied with the proper plan to \nexecute, through staffing and scheduling. To complete the process efficiently, four \nAssociates, including the Backroom Coordinator should be scheduled at a minimum of \nfour hours, ideally 7am-11am, and taking a break prior to store opening. Additional \nAssociates may be needed to continue flowing merchandise, after the truck has been \nprocessed. Truck processing should take place the day after the truck has arrived. For \nexample, if trucks arrive on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays, the processing team \nshould be scheduled Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. \n \nThe goal is to process and flow merchandise to the sales floor within 24 hours. To flow \nmerchandise to the sales floor efficiently, productivity should be tracked to ensure the \nprocess stays on target. While processing, the cartons per hour goal is 7.0 and \nshould be achieved through proper setup of the backroom. While flowing merchandise \nto the sales floor, each vehicle that holds merchandise has a standard time to complete, \ne.g., a z-rack should be flowed to the department in approximately 20 minutes. It is \nimportant that Associates are aware of the productivity standards and are coached and \ntrained accordingly. Each Associate should keep track of their processing time. \n \n \nJob aids for equipment use, processing positions, and EAS standards should be placed \nin visible locations in the backroom.  \n",

The overall layout should work from the truck door, toward the \nsales floor.

These boxes allow for more footwear to fit within a box. \n\u2022 Footwear tanks are separated by gender and boxes are sized \naccordingly \n\u2022 Save apparel boxes to use for footwear overstock and to use for flowing \n\u2022 Labels may need to be created to represent sizes, as shown below \n \n \n",
